# Helper: Register as Trusted Catalog (Fallback)

If the direct Developer registration failed (blocked only), we can try adding this folder as a "Trusted Catalog".

1. Run `register_catalog.bat`.
2. Restart Outlook.
3. Open "Get Add-ins" (All Apps).
4. Look for a new tab called **"Shared Folder"**.
5. Your add-in should be inside there.

## Also Check:
- **Uninstall VSTO**: Did you uninstall the previous VSTO version from "Add or Remove Programs"? It might be conflicting.
- **Enable Optional Connected Experiences**: Go to **File > Office Account > Account Privacy > Manage Settings**. Ensure "Optional connected experiences" is checked (needed for Web Add-ins).
